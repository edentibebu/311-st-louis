How to use the site:

The Map-

The tooltip for the map displays more detailed information and statistics about a specific block group. The content of the tooltip is visible on hover. The format of the tooltip is as follows: Total calls or average time to close Racial demographics of the block group (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native) Percentage of adults living below the poverty level in the block group Neighborhoods of St. Louis overlapping with the block group

The Controls-

There are two radio buttons that toggle the type of data represented by the map. By clicking the radio button labelled "Count of Calls", the map displays the values of the number of service calls made in each block group. By clicking the radio button lablled "Mean Days to Close", the map displays the average time (in days) recorded to close or resolve the case corresponding to the service call that was made. Calls for service are divided into twelve different groups. You can select or deselect each category based on whether or not you want to include that data. If call counts are being visualized, then calls are added across checked categories. If average time to call closure is being visualized, the time to closure is averaged checked categories. The "Select All" and "Deselect All" buttons are there to expedite the checking process. Drag year slider to progress through the years from 2014 to 2022. Doing this updates the map data to only display the number of calls or average days to close that were made during that corresponding year.
